# Arabic Handwritten Character Recognition

This project focuses on classifying Arabic handwritten characters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a labeled dataset and implemented entirely in Jupyter Notebook. The repository includes the dataset, preprocessing steps, model training and evaluation, and a saved model for future inference.
